      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a final-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in building reliable and well-structured systems. 
        My background includes programming, hardware, and low-level system design, which has shaped how I think about correctness, 
        constraints, and edge cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my Final Year Project, I’m working on a deepfake detection system where I apply image processing and deep learning 
        techniques to identify manipulated multimedia content. Through this work, I’ve learned that model accuracy alone is not enough. 
        Outputs must be consistent, interpretable, and robust across real-world conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working on problems where structure matters, whether that’s digital logic, system architecture, or constrained AI systems. 
        I’m particularly interested in areas where learning-based models need to be combined with validation and rules to avoid unreliable results.
